eureka search engine
====================

A simple and easy to use search server written in node.js and MongoDb.

### Architecture

![Architecture](architecture.png)

Search-Crawler is composed by a Node.Js web application to manage one or more websites and a set of json based REST API that can be used to query crawled pages and integrate the result inside any existing website.

Website crawling is implemented using [Christopher Giffard's SimpleCrawler](https://github.com/cgiffard/node-simplecrawler). Pages are stored in a MongoDb and search is powered by a full text mongodb query, see [full text index](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/index-text/).

### Features

- Embedded crawler and parser
- MongoDB powered full text search
- Available as REST API
- Can manage multiple websites
- Customizable content selector (you can select which part of the page to parse)
- Can crawl an entire domain or just a website section
- Scheduled crawling with cron syntax (using https://github.com/ncb000gt/node-cron)

### Installation

To install search-crawler you need the following components:

- Node.Js (>= 0.10.28)
- MongoDb (>= 2.6)


Get the latest version of search-crawler at github.
Install it by running the following command inside the folder
where you have downloaded the package:

    npm install

These will install in the current folder all the required libraries.

After installation you can execute the node.js application by executing:

    npm run server

or

    node index.js

The web server is created at port 8181, so you can browse it at [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181).
Search-Crawler try to connect to a mongo database using the following url:

	mongodb://localhost:27017/search-crawler

See Configuration section for more information.

### Configuration

`./src/config.js` file contains all the parameters used by `search-crawler`.
Here some of the parameters:

	// Allowed extension for crawling
	config.crawler.allowedUrlPatterns = [
			"/[^./]*$" // extension less
			,"\\.(html|htm|aspx|php)$" // .html + .htm
			];
	// List of content types to process
	config.crawler.contentTypes = ["text/html"];
	// crawler interval
	config.crawler.interval = 300;
	// crawler maxConcurrency
	config.crawler.maxConcurrency = 2;

	// mongo host and database (mongodb version => 2.6 required)
	config.db.mongo = {};
	config.db.mongo.ip = process.env.IP || "localhost";
	config.db.mongo.url = "mongodb://" + config.db.mongo.ip + ":27017/search-crawler";


	// html "jquery style" selector for the body content (es. "body", "article", "div#text")
	//  can be override on each site
	config.parser.defaultContentSelector = "body";

	// nodejs server listening port
	config.web.port = process.env.PORT || process.env.WEB_PORT || 8181;
	config.web.ip = process.env.IP;


See `./src/config.js` for all available parameters.

To create a custom configuration you can edit `config.js` file or you can create
a custom startup file like `contoso.index.js` with a content like:

    // Here I can modify configuration...
    var config = require('./src/config.js');
    config.web.port = 8282;

    // then run real index.js
    require('./index.js');

And then instead of executing index.js you can execute your custom
`contoso.index.js`. This method has the advantage that you don't modify any
original file.

Each website has also it's own configuration
 (stored in mongodb inside each site document):

- site.config.contentSelector - the HTML selector that must be used for text search
- site.config.urlPattern - regex pattern that urls must match
- site.config.crawlingCron - (optional) cron expression to controll the scheduled crawling

These configuration can be edited using the web application or through the API.

### Scheduled crawling

To configure automatic crawling of website you should set the `crawlingCron`
configuration with your required frequency specified as a cron expression.
Below a quick CRON guide.

Remember that to apply any changed in the cron scheduled expression
you have to reload jobs using the appropriate command or restart the node application.

#### CRON Quick guide

- `* * * * * *` = every seconds<br/>
- `0 * * * * *` = every minutes at second 0<br/>
- `0 5 * * * *` = every hours at minute 5<br/>
- `0 0 1 * * *` = every days at 1 AM


### REST API

Other then the user interface the following REST API are available:

#### GET `/api/sites/:siteName/search?query=:query&limit=:limit`

Search for a given expression inside a site. The result is a json with the list of pages that match the query with the following format:

	[
	    {
	        "_id": "54550c07b242a89d4c862e6e",
	        "title": "Page Title",
	        "description": "Page description",
	        "url": "http://pageurl",
	        "score": 1.5690104166666665,
	        "keywords": [
	            "key1",
	            "key2"
	        ]
	    },
	    {
	    	...
	    }
	]

#### GET `/api/sites`
